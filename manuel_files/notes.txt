detect cloudless days (flag them?)
thresholds of 5%?
Tilt of 2 week threshold for negative values + maybe magnitude?
Tilt for 3-4+ cloudless days in a row?

tilt detection (thresholds) to determine if real time data shows tilt? (alerts) - Allows for enhanced reactive maintenance to exceeding thresholds

try to convert and then use the tilt script --> build in thresholds and test them on the data? (Use the obvious tilt section of the data)







pcorr seems ~ 1% off? Possible a rounding error?
