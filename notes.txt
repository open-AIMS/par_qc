detect cloudless days (flag them?)
thresholds of 5%?
Tilt of 2 week threshold for negative values + maybe magnitude?
Tilt for 3-4+ cloudless days in a row?

tilt detection (thresholds) to determine if real time data shows tilt? (alerts) - Allows for enhanced reactive maintenance to exceeding thresholds

try to convert and then use the tilt script --> build in thresholds and test them on the data? (Use the obvious tilt section of the data)







pcorr seems ~ 1% off? Possible a rounding error?

How exactly is Corr PAR calculated?

Current: 
pratio = 0.0001221 * dataframe['dn'].iloc[i] + 0.95767

corrpar = dataframe['rawpar'].iloc[i] * pratio

Where does 0.0001221 and 0.95767 come from?



Par(Corr)(d,z) = Par(Raw) * c1(d) * c2(z)

c1: Depends on days after deployment (d)
c2: depends on zenith angle (z) - We assume this to be 1 with our assumption of <5% error due to delineation (We will QC high tilt values out later?)

c1(d) = Par(mod)(Noon)/Par(Raw)(Noon)
